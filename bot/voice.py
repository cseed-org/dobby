"""Dobby's voice: one text file per situation, one phrasing per line.

`say()` reads the file for a key on every call, picks one line at random, formats it and
returns it. Nothing is cached, so the phrasings live in memory only for the duration of
the call. Lines starting with `#` and blank lines are ignored. A line may only use the
placeholders listed in FIELDS for its key; other lines are skipped as unusable.
